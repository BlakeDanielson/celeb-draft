## Death Draft — Project Roadmap

### High-level Goals
- Private, invite-only “death draft” with simple snake drafting and live sync.
- No auth; minimal fields; focus on fast, reliable draft experience.

### MVP Feature Checklist
- [x] PRD drafted and agreed
- [ ] Create league with name, team cap (2–20), picks per team (5)
- [ ] Invite link generation and join via display name
- [ ] Join lock when draft starts
- [ ] Randomized snake draft (5 rounds); prevent duplicate picks
- [ ] Shared per-league celebrity pool; add pre/during; prevent duplicates
- [ ] Basic search over celebrity names
- [ ] Live sync ≤5s for joins/adds/picks
- [ ] Simple draft board and recap views

### Completion Criteria
- A group can create a league, all members join via link, complete a 5-round snake draft with live updates, and view a recap — without auth, timers, or exports.

### Future Considerations
- Auth, undo/timers/auto-pick, chat/moderation, exports, analytics, bulk import.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] MVP PRD created (this version)
