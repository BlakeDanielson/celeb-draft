## Current Task

### Objective
Triage Task Master tasks, expand into actionable subtasks, and begin MVP implementation starting with Task 1 (Setup Project Structure and Database Schema).

### Context
- Task Master initialized; PRD parsed into `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` with 15 tasks.
- Decisions: 2–20 teams, 5 picks per team, snake, randomized order, no timer/auto-pick/undo, invite-only, no auth, shared celebrity pool (name only), anyone can add pre/during, duplicates prevented, live sync ≤5s, recap only.

### Next Steps
- Review generated tasks and priorities in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`.
- Expand key tasks into subtasks as needed (backend APIs, draft engine, realtime, frontend UIs).
- Start with Task 1: Setup project structure and database schema.
