## Current Task

### Objective
Finalize and store the MVP PRD for the Death Draft app, then proceed to implementation planning.

### Context
- Decisions: 2–20 teams, 5 picks per team, snake, randomized order, no timer/auto-pick/undo, invite-only, no auth, shared celebrity pool (name only), anyone can add pre/during, duplicates prevented, live sync ≤5s, recap only.

### Next Steps
- Confirm PRD is accepted.
- Draft implementation plan (milestones, API/DB sketch) based on PRD.
- Begin MVP build (league creation, join, pool, draft engine, realtime, UI).
